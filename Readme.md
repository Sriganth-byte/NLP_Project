Below is a clean, professional README.md template you can directly use.
It explicitly includes Kaggle dataset download steps before running the project, which is what evaluators usually look for.

You can copy–paste this into README.md and adjust the dataset name/link if needed.

📊 Machine Learning / Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on applying machine learning and data analysis techniques to extract insights and build predictive models from real-world data.
The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

🧰 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

📥 Dataset Download (Required Before Running)

⚠️ Important: The dataset is hosted on Kaggle and must be downloaded before executing the project.

🔹 Step 1: Create a Kaggle Account
